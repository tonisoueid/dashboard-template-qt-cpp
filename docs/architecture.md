# Architecture

A polled-telemetry operations console: an editable roster of watched sites,
a staggered polling service, a rule engine whose events log raise and clear,
and a fully custom-painted dark UI. One executable, no runtime dependencies
beyond Qt 6 (Widgets + Network).

## Data flow (one direction only)

```
SiteRegistry ──► FeedService ──► MainWindow ──► SiteCard / TrendChart / EventLog
   (roster)      (polling)       (wiring:
                                  timers, alert
                                  diffing, selection)
```

Nothing downstream reaches back up. `SiteRegistry` owns the roster and
persists it; `FeedService` turns roster entries into `SiteData` samples;
`MainWindow` wires signals to widgets and diffs watch rules; the widgets
only paint what they are handed.

## Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/SiteData.h` | Data model (`Site`, `Sample`, `SiteData`), default roster, watch rules (`evaluateAlerts`). Everything downstream follows its missing-data convention. |
| `src/SiteRegistry.{h,cpp}` | Editable roster persisted as `sites.json` in `QStandardPaths::AppConfigLocation`. `setSites()` normalizes → validates → persists (`QSaveFile`) → emits. |
| `src/FeedService.{h,cpp}` | Round-robin polling, one in-flight request per site, staggered `kStaggerMs` apart, full sweep every `kRefreshSecs`. **Ships as a documented stub — the feed seam.** |
| `src/MainWindow.{h,cpp}` | Owns the timers; diffs `evaluateAlerts` between samples so the event log records raise, severity change and clear ("…nominal"). Hotkeys, selection, panel focus. |
| `src/SiteCard.{h,cpp}` | Per-site instrument tile, custom `QPainter`. |
| `src/widgets/TrendChart.{h,cpp}` | Dual-scale history trace for the selected site. |
| `src/EventLog.{h,cpp}` | Timestamped UTC log, capped at 300 lines. |
| `src/AdminDialog.{h,cpp}` | Roster editor (table + form). Only stylesheet user. |
| `src/widgets/Panel`, `ExpandButton`, `BodySplitter` | Captioned card chrome, caption-corner expand, draggable body seam. |
| `src/widgets/IconGlyph.h` | Deterministic SVG-path parser + verbatim Bootstrap Icons artwork. |
| `src/Theme.h` | Palette, typography, drawing primitives — the design system. |
| `src/AppIcon.h` | Painted app icon (no bitmap assets anywhere). |

## The patterns worth keeping intact

### Missing-data convention

Every measurement starts NaN (doubles) or -1 (ints). The UI renders explicit
gaps — `---`, dashed baselines, "AWAITING FIRST SCAN" — and never zero.
Check `std::isnan` / `< 0` before using any value. A feed that omits a field
must leave it invalid; nothing downstream may invent a reading.

### Staggered sweep, degraded-not-dropped

`FeedService` walks the roster like a NOC polling telemetry stations:
`pollSite(0)`, 450 ms later `pollSite(1)`, …, then the sweep is done and the
next one is armed `kRefreshSecs` out. One request is in flight per site at
most. On failure the site degrades — Live → **Stale** (last good sample
retained, data age grows) or Pending → **Error** — and the header LINK chip
flips. Recovery is symmetric. To change the sweep interval edit **only**
`kRefreshSecs` (the status-bar countdown reads it).

### Generation counter (retires superseded replies)

The roster is hot-swappable at runtime. `setSites()` bumps `m_generation`;
every in-flight network reply captured the generation it was issued under
and drops itself if the number moved — the reply's site index no longer
names the site that was polled. The same pattern guards any async lookup
you add — search-as-you-type fields, secondary feeds, anything where a
reply can outlive the state that issued it. Consequences:

- Samples survive a roster edit when the site's `code` **and** `endpoint`
  are unchanged.
- **Site indexes change after a swap (`sitesReconfigured`) — never cache an
  index across it.**

### History window

`applySample()` appends to `SiteData::recent`, capped at `kHistoryCap`
(default 48). Everything historical — card sparkline, trend chart, trend
watch rules — reads that window; nothing else keeps its own buffer.

### Alert diffing (raise / severity-change / clear)

`evaluateAlerts()` is a pure function of one `SiteData`. `MainWindow`
stores the last result per site keyed by the rule's stable `key` and diffs:

- new key → log the raise,
- same key, different severity → log "raised to CRITICAL" / "lowered to
  WARNING",
- vanished key → log "<rule> nominal".

This is why alert **keys must be stable identifiers** and changing values
belong in the message, not the key. Derived/forecast-style rules
(early warnings computed from history) follow the same diffing but log at
their own level — see docs/recipes.md "Add a derived-rule class".

### Persistence

`SiteRegistry` writes `sites.json` (versioned object, `QSaveFile` so a
crash never truncates it) under `AppConfigLocation`
(`~/.config/<appname>/` on Linux, `%APPDATA%` on Windows). A corrupt or
invalid file falls back to the built-in defaults and logs a WARN — the
console always boots.

### Calm UI

Cards repaint on data updates and a minute tick, not per second; the only
things that move at 1 Hz or faster live in the window header (UTC clock,
blinking LIVE dot, scan counter). New card elements must stay static
between minute ticks and data updates.

## Verifying without a GUI

Built-in headless modes (always `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`):

- `--offline` — link-down drill, no polling, `R` disabled
- `--grab FILE` — render one frame after the first scan completes
  (30 s fallback exit; give `--offline --grab` runs an outer timeout ≥ 45 s)
- `--grab-admin PREFIX` — scripted admin-dialog add + save, screenshots to
  `PREFIX-*.png`
- `--icon FILE` — render the 256 px app icon

For interaction or data-path testing, write an ad-hoc CMake harness in
`/tmp` that links the real widgets from `src/`, drives them directly (e.g.
`FeedService::applySample()` with synthetic samples) and grabs full windows
— a bare `widget->grab()` shows alpha-garbage at transparent edges, so host
the widget in an opaque window first. This repo was validated exactly that
way; keep the habit.
